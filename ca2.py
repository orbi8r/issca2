Changes Summary:
- Function definition: Added missing colon.
- Semicolons: Removed unnecessary ones.
- Variable names: Fixed errors ('targ' → 'target', 'sol' → 'solutions', 'pair' → 'pairs').
- Exponentiation: Corrected ('***' → '**', fixed exponent values).
- Functions: Replaced incorrect ones ('ranges' → 'range', 'printf' → 'print').
- Target value: Corrected from 1728 to 1729 where applicable.
This code solves the problem of finding pairs of integers whose cubes sum to a given target. 
The `find_cube_pairs` function takes a target number, iterates through possible integer pairs, 
and checks if their cubes add up to the target. It returns a list of such pairs as tuples. 
The main code calls this function with 1729 as the target and prints the resulting pairs.
